# How to Use the WakuConnect Vote SDK

To demonstrate how to use the WakuConnect Vote SDK in your dApp,
we will create a TypeScript React app from scratch.

You can then adapt the steps depending on your dApp configuration and build setup.

Only token holders can create, vote and finalize proposals.
Hence, you need to have an ERC-20 token contract address ready.

The resulting code of this guide can be found at
TODO.

Here is a preview of the end result:
